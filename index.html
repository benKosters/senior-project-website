            <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Commercial Internet speed test platforms are widely used to evaluate network performance, but some of
                their internal implementation and network performance metrics are not publicly available. This lack of
                transparency and standardization makes it difficult to compare results or understand what they mean.
                This project will be made up of multiple phases. The first phase is to perform an in-depth analysis of
                the behavior of Ookla, the largest Internet speed test platform, by using Netlog captures collected
                during a browser-based speed test. This work builds off of previous work performed in the Spring 2025
                semester. The goal through the first half of the Fall 2025 semester is to perform more tests to validate
                our initial findings and then submit a publishable paper to IMC. A significant portion of this paper
                will also investigate different models of throughput measurement. After this paper has been written, we
                will shift to validating a toolkit developed by CAIDA at UC San Diego. This toolkit is used as a wrapper
                to standardize the parameters for various speed test platforms, thus making them more comparable. By
                looking deeper into Ookla’s implementation, we can verify that the toolkit developed by CAIDA works as
                intended.

            <h2>Project Background</h2>
            <p>
                This project was initially started in 2023 by CAIDA at UC San Diego, who developed an open source
                toolkit
                called RABBITS, which is a wrapper over six speed test platforms to provide standardized
                parameters for running speed tests. In the Spring of 2024, a senior project team from Calvin University
                began working on the
                project. Their work involved
                using Netlog captures to extract important data and perform an initial analysis of RABBITS using the
                Ookla speed test server.
                In their analysis, the team examined the effect of the number of TCP flows and the size of the HTTP
                message
                request on the throughput measurement.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Spring of 2025, we povioted to investigating the behavior of Ookla in more detail. By doing so,
                we can then return to RABBITs and perform a comparative analysis.
                We produced an initial paper in the beginning of the Spring, and will be returning to this paper to
                validate the initial claims.
                Over the Summer of 2025, a Summer Researcher worked on this project as well. Measuring the internet has
                a
                substantial community, and there is an annual Internet Measurement Conference (IMC). The ICM allows
                papers to be published on various internet measuring investigations. ArXiv also has a repository of
                related research to internet measuring, such as a paper on early termination of speed tests to reduce
                unnecessary traffic
            </p>
            <p>
                Most Internet speed test platforms, except for M-Lab, generally use the same measurement method which is
                to flood the network with synthetic data to the point where a bottleneck is reached. This bottleneck is
                the narrowest bandwidth in both the download paths and upload paths. In order to flood the bottleneck
                along the network path, a large amount of data must be sent. If the volume of data is too low, the
                bottleneck will not be saturated and throughput measurements will be an under-estimate of the true
                throughput. Speed tests are also traditionally performed on the “last mile” server, which is the closest
                server to the user.
